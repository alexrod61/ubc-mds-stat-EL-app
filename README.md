# Sample Teaching Materials for the Application to [Assistant Professor of Teaching - MDS/STAT](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/faculty-position-education-leadership-department-statistics)

This repository contains three sample teaching materials. They are part of my application for the position of Assistant Professor of Teaching - MDS/STAT in Education Leadership. The contents are briefly explained as follows:

 - **Statistical Inference and Computation I (DSCI 552):** This MDS course covers frequentist approaches for statistical inference. It is split into two parts: simulation and theory-based methods. These sample lecture notes in Jupyter book are the last ones in the course and part of the theory-based techniques. The central topic is maximum likelihood estimation in a univariate framework. The sample lecture was built during the Fall 2021 term and revamped the Fall 2022. It is based on previous course material with extensive changes.
- **Regression II (DSCI 562):** This MDS course covers advanced regression techniques. It is the continuation of *Regression I* (*DSCI 561*), where the program covers ordinary least-squares. The first two lectures in this course introduction to regression-based cases where the ordinary least-squares method is not suitable. Then, we proceed to binary logistic and count regressions. These sample lecture notes are also built in Jupyter book. The material was mainly made during the Winter 2021 term, with significant revamping during this current academic term. It is based on previous course material with extensive changes.
